🧭 High-Level Plan
You currently have:

One private repo (me50)

Each folder committed to a different branch

You want to merge all branches into a new public repo

Final structure should be:

cpp
Copy
Edit
public-repo/
  project1/
  project2/
  ...
🛠️ Step-by-Step Plan
✅ Step 1: Prepare the Repositories
Clone your private repo locally (me50)

Create a new empty GitHub public repo (let's call it public-me50)

Initialize a new local repo for public-me50

✅ Step 2: Bring in the History from Each Branch
For each branch (e.g., branch1):

Check out that branch into a temporary local branch

Move all its files into a new folder (e.g., move everything into project1/)

Commit this folder move to preserve history structure

Repeat this for all branches:

branch2 → project2/

branch3 → project3/

and so on

Each of these branches now looks like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
projectX/
  (files from branchX)
✅ Step 3: Combine into a Single Branch
Create a new main branch in the public repo

Sequentially merge each modified branch (branch1, branch2, etc.) into main

These merges are manual and unrelated, so Git will need to be told to allow it

As a result, main now contains all folders side-by-side with their full history

✅ Step 4: Push to GitHub
Add your public GitHub repo as a remote

Push the main branch to GitHub

Now your public repo is live, clean, with:

All original history per folder

No submodules

No broken commits

Everything on one main branch

🎁 Final Result:
Your new repo (public-me50) will look like:

cpp
Copy
Edit
public-me50/
  ├── project1/   # from branch1
  ├── project2/   # from branch2
  ├── ...
Each folder keeps its full commit history, as if it always lived there.
